# modify_participants_fame_values 																																											#
# by Sean Hughes 																																															#
#																																																			#
# Description: Makes the correct adjustments to prestige or piety for each participant in a war. 																											#
#																																																			#
# Parameters:																																																#
#	WINNER: The character who won the war.																																									#
#	LOSER: The character who lost the war.																																									#
#	IS_RELIGIOUS_WAR: If yes we will modify Piety values instead of Prestige values.																														#
#	FAME_BASE: The base value for calculating how much Prestige or Piety is gained/lost by each character, as below:																						#
#	  WINNER_FAME_SCALE: The winner will receive Prestige/Piety equal to FAME_BASE multiplied by this scale.																								#
#	  LOSER_FAME_SCALE: The winner will receive Prestige/Piety equal to FAME_BASE multiplied by this scale. **NOTE: This value should always be negative, otherwise the loser will gain piety/prestige!**	#
#	  WINNER_ALLY_FAME_SCALE: Winner's allies will receive Prestige/Piety based on FAME_BASE, multiplied by this scale, then adjusted based on their War Contributuion.										#
#	  LOSER_ALLY_FAME_SCALE: As above, but for the loser's side. ** NOTE: In the current design this should always be the same as WINNER_ALLY_FAME_SCALE, but I'm splitting it out in order to future-proof	#
#		this effect in case the design changes or modders want to alter how it works. **																													#

# modify_allies_of_participants_fame_values																																									#
# by Sean Hughes 																																															#
#																																																			#
# Description: Makes the correct adjustments to prestige or piety but ONLY for the allies in a war (e.g., not the primary attacker/defender).																#
#	Used as part of 'modify_participants_fame_values' but can also be used on it's own where desired, such as in a white peace where you don't want to give the primary participants any prestige/piety.	#
#																																																			#
# Parameters:																																																#
#	WINNER: The character who won the war.																																									#
#	IS_RELIGIOUS_WAR: If yes we will modify Piety values instead of Prestige values.																														#
